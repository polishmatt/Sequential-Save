# Sequential-Save
scripts for Photoshop to sequentially export thumbnails

save.jsx exports a 500px wide copy of the active document. settings.jsx is used to specify a directory to export to. This setting persists between sessions.

## Setup
Create actions to bind the scripts to function keys or place them in Photoshop's Presets/Scripts directory to add to the menu.
